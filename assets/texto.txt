  You are Renne Bras, an ordinary 
    detective. You entered the business 
    seven years ago, just after the 


 dialog_001
  end of your longest relationship. 
    You became famous for solving the 
    case of kidnappings in the capital. 


 dialog_002
  Ever since you never picked up 
    jobs that involved disappearance  
    cases. 


 dialog_003
  Everything changed when days ago 
    you received a message from an old 
    friend. 


 dialog_004
  Renne long time no see, I am sending 
    this message because I am running  
    out of hope. A couple of my friends 


 dialog_005
  went missing a week ago. I called 
    the police but they were unable to 
    find evidence to proceed. 


 dialog_006
  I would like to hire you to investi- 
    gate this case. I live in Sao Bento 
    do Oeste, Minas Gerais, near the 


 dialog_007
  border with Sao Paulo. Please help 
    me Renne, you are my only hope. 
    With love, - Julia.

 dialog_017  
     Julia 
                Long time no see.
     
    


 dialog_018  
     Renne 
                Yes, it does.
     
    


 dialog_019  
     Renne 
                I would love to spend an
    afternoon talking with you... 
    


 dialog_020  
     Julia 
                Oh Right, the case.
     
    


 dialog_021  
     Renne 
                I will ask you a few 
    questions, feel free to ask back 
    anytime.


 dialog_022  
     Julia 
                Okay.
     
    


 dialog_023  
     Renne 
                Who are the couple of
    friends you mentioned? 
    


 dialog_024  
     Julia 
                Their names are Cristiano
    Machado and Alice Zena. I known them 
    for almost three years.


 dialog_025  
     Julia 
                Are they married, friends 
    or something else? 
    


 dialog_026  
     Julia 
                They are dating. I
    remember Alice telling me that she 
    was waiting for Cris to ask her..


 dialog_027  
     Renne 
                I see. What was their 
    jobs? 
    


 dialog_028  
     Julia 
                Cristiano was a lawyer,
    he had an office on 15th March Street 
    the main street of the city.


 dialog_029  
     Julia 
                Alice was a Portuguese 
    teacher at the school I work at. 
    


 dialog_030  
     Renne 
                How would you describe
    their relationship? 
    


 dialog_031  
     Julia 
                They seemed very close, 
    a perfect couple. I never saw them  
    fight...


 dialog_032  
     Renne 
                Hum.. 
     
    


 dialog_033  
     Julia 
                I'm sorry did I say
    something? 
    


 dialog_034  
     Renne 
                No, I just remembered one
    thing... Please continue. 
    


 dialog_035  
     Julia 
                They were... I mean they
    are a beautiful couple. 
    


 dialog_036  
     Renne 
                As I understand it, you
    were much closer to Alice than to 
    Cristiano right?


 dialog_037  
     Julia 
                Yes.
     
    


 dialog_038  
     Renne 
                About Cristiano, you knew 
    something about his life beyond what  
    Alice told you...


 dialog_039  
     Julia 
                As far as I remember he
    used to go to drink in the bar in  
    front of his office.


 dialog_040  
     Renne 
                Did you knew Cristiano
    before his relationship with Alice? 
    


 dialog_041  
     Julia 
                Just by sight.
     
    


 dialog_042  
     Renne 
                Right. About the
    disappearance, how you noticed that 
    both were gone.


 dialog_043  
     Julia 
                They don't have a car, so
    I saw them every day walking to work. 
    


 dialog_044  
     Julia 
                A week ago Alice said that 
    she wanted to go to the lighthouse. 
    


 dialog_045  
     Renne 
                Lighthouse?
     
    


 dialog_046  
     Julia 
                Yes, the City lighthouse.
     
    


 dialog_047  
     Renne 
                Why does this city have
    a lighthouse? We are in Minas Gerais, 
    there no sea.


 dialog_048  
     Julia 
                It is the city monument,
    they built it to be a tourist spot  
    for the city.



 dialog_049  
     Renne 
                Anyway, let's continue.
     
    


 dialog_050  
     Julia 
                Alice said she would go
    to the lighthouse. Once I heard it, I 
    thought that Cristiano would ask her.


 dialog_051  
     Renne 
                Oh.
     
    


 dialog_052  
     Julia 
                Since then I have not 
    heard any more news from the two,  
    both have stopped showing up at their


 dialog_053  
     Julia 
                work, the house has been 
    abandoned, and from what I talked, 
    nobody has seen them since ever since



 dialog_054  
     Renne 
                Copy, Is there anything 
    else you want to tell me?  
    


 dialog_055  
     Julia 
                I don't think so.
     
    


 dialog_056  
     Renne 
                Okay, I'm going to 
    walk around town, to collect some 
    testimonies, if that's okay with you?


 dialog_057  
     Julia 
                It's all right.
     
    


 dialog_058  
     Julia 
                Do you want me to partner
    you? 
    


 dialog_059  
     Renne 
                I would love to, but it
    can affect how people talk to me. 
    


 dialog_060  
     Julia 
                I never thought this
    way. 
    


 dialog_061  
     Renne 
                It's not a big deal, 
    it's just one of my working habits. 
    


 dialog_062  
     Julia 
                Have a nice day then.
     
    


 dialog_063  
     Renne 
                You too.
     
    


 dialog_064  
     Renne 
                And before I forget, after 
    all this we are going to have a real 
    dinner together.


 dialog_065  
     Julia 
                Oh do you still remember
    that... 
    


 dialog_066  
     Julia 
                Ok, it is settled then.
     
    









 dialog_068
  Sao Bento do Oeste 
    15th March Street 
    Minutes later 



 dialog_070  
     Sabrina 
                 Damn it! Who the hell is
    doing this. 
    


 dialog_071  
     Sabrina 
                 I will find out who is
    responsible for these burned   
    dumpsters.


 dialog_072  
     Sabrina 
                 Anyway, here I am 
    Cristiano's office. I will put an  
    end to this. 


 dialog_073  
     Renne 
                Hey you, stop right there. 
     
    



 dialog_075  
     Renne 
                You can't go in there! 
    This place is close due to an  
    investigation.


 dialog_076  
     Sabrina 
                 I know that's why I'm 
    here. 
    


 dialog_077  
     Renne 
                Who are you?
     
    


 dialog_078  
     Sabrina 
                 You first, it was you who  
    showed up accusing me. 
    


 dialog_079  
     Renne 
                Okay, my name is Renne
    Bras, I'm a hired detective. I'm 
    working on this case.


 dialog_080  
     Sabrina 
                 Julia's friend?
     
    


 dialog_081  
     Renne 
                Yes, and who are you?
     
    


 dialog_082  
     Sabrina 
                 My name is Sabrina I am
    a teacher at the same school as Alice 
    I am investigating this case solo.


 dialog_083  
     Renne 
                I see. Let's go in  
    together then. 
    


 dialog_084  
     Renne 
                But first, let me ask you 
    a few questions. 
    


 dialog_085  
     Renne 
                Could you think of anyone 
    behind  all this. 
    


 dialog_086  
     Sabrina 
                 Cristiano.
     
    


 dialog_087  
     Renne 
                Oh..
     
    


 dialog_088  
     Renne 
                Why him? 
     
    


 dialog_089  
     Sabrina 
                 He always seemed to hide 
    something. Alice said it was his way,  
    but I always had my suspicions.


 dialog_090  
     Renne 
                About Alice, do you think 
    she was taken to the lighthouse by  
    force?


 dialog_091  
     Sabrina 
                 No, she liked it there. 
    I have a strong suspicion that she  
    went with him without knowing more... 


 dialog_092  
     Renne 
                Do you think it's a murder
    case? 
    


 dialog_093  
     Sabrina 
                 Yes, after the police  
    found the car they used abandoned at 
    the ligthouse I felt it was a murder. 


 dialog_094  
     Renne 
                Wait, Julia told me they
    didn't have a car.  
    


 dialog_095  
     Sabrina 
                 They bought one recently. 
    I know because I was at the car sale  
    that day. 


 dialog_096  
     Renne 
                Where and when this car
    sale happen? And what car was it? 
    


 dialog_097  
     Sabrina 
                 It was in the church 
    square, about ten days ago. And it 
    was a green Golf.


 dialog_098  
     Renne 
                Before you came here to 
    investigate the office, you found  
    anything else suspicious?


 dialog_099  
     Sabrina 
                 Let me see..
     
    


 dialog_100  
     Sabrina 
                 The burned dumpsters.
     
    


 dialog_101  
     Sabrina 
                 Starting a week ago, 
    someone begin to set fire to the  
    city's dumpsters.


 dialog_102  
     Renne 
                That time interval, there
    is something there. 
    


 dialog_103  
     Sabrina 
                 Anything else? 
      
    


 dialog_104
  Choose your next question 
      Press B to ask about Alice 
      Press C to ask about Julia 


 dialog_104_1_01
     Renne 
                Tell me more about Alice
    how was she, what she liked to do in 
    her spare time.. anything.


 dialog_104_1_02
     Sabrina 
                 Alice? She was lovely.
    We often travel together, either  
    to the waterfall or anywhere else.


 dialog_104_1_03
     Renne 
                You two were very close.. 
    I imagine that after she fell in love 
    with Cristiano everything changed.


 dialog_104_1_04
     Sabrina 
                 Yes, I considered that 
    to be the break of our friendship. 
    


 dialog_104_1_05
     Renne 
                Hmm. 
     
    


 dialog_104_1_06
     Renne 
                Despite everything you 
    still have a feeling for Alice,  
    that's why you want this case.


 dialog_104_1_07
     Sabrina 
                 ... 
     
    


 dialog_104_1_08
     Renne 
                Without further ado, let's
    enter Cristiano's office.  
    


 dialog_104_2_01
     Renne 
                Tell me more about Julia
    how was she, what she liked to do in 
    her spare time.. anything.


 dialog_104_2_02
     Sabrina 
                 Julia? She is a good 
    friend, we have worked together for  
    years.


 dialog_104_2_03
     Renne 
                What about her social 
    life? 
    


 dialog_104_2_04
     Sabrina 
                 She is very closed, 
    since I met her I have never seen her 
    with anyone for more than a month.


 dialog_104_2_05
     Renne 
                The same old Julia. 
     
    


 dialog_104_2_06
     Renne 
                Do you believe that 
    Julia would have hidden anything  
    from my investigation?


 dialog_104_2_07
     Sabrina 
                 Her social life. From 
    what I know of Julia, I assume you  
    two have a past. She probably hid


 dialog_104_2_08
     Sabrina 
                 information about her 
    mental health.  
    


 dialog_104_2_09
     Renne 
                Hmm. I can't do 
    anything about this right now.  
    


 dialog_104_2_10
     Renne 
                Without further ado, let's
    enter Cristiano's office.  
    




 dialog_106
  Thirty minutes later. 
      
      


 dialog_107
  You and Sabrina spent thirty minutes  
    searching Cristiano's office. 
      



 dialog_109
     Sabrina 
                 Damn it. 
     
    


 dialog_110
     Sabrina 
                 There's nothing here. 
     
    


 dialog_111
     Renne 
                This means that the 
    reason behind the disappearance  
    is not related work.


 dialog_112
     Sabrina 
                 Hmm. 
     
    


 dialog_113
     Sabrina 
                 That was a dead end.
     
    


 dialog_114
     Renne 
                ... 
     
    


 dialog_115
     Renne 
                Not so much.
     
    


 dialog_116
     Sabrina 
                 Why?
     
    


 dialog_117
     Renne 
                Julia told me that 
    Cristiano often came to drink in the  
    front bar of his office.


 dialog_118
     Renne 
                We can work on the 
    hypothesis that Cristiano made his  
    decisions at the bar, not at work. 


 dialog_119
     Sabrina 
                 Makes sense.
     
    


 dialog_120
     Sabrina 
                 What will you do?
     
    


 dialog_121
     Renne 
                Continue to investigate..  
    You can continue to investigate on   
    your own if you want. 


 dialog_122
     Sabrina 
                 OK good luck.
     
    


 dialog_123
     Renne 
                Same to you.  
     
    










 dialog_125
  Sao Bento do Oeste 
    Church square 
    Minutes later 



 dialog_127
     Carlos 
                My job here is done.
      
     




 dialog_129
     Renne 
                Hey... My name is Renne
    I am running an investigation on a 
    disappearance in this city.


 dialog_130
     Renne 
                Can I talk to you for a 
    second? 
    


 dialog_131
     Carlos 
                Of course. Ask me 
    anything.  
     


 dialog_132
     Renne 
                What is your name, age  
    and occupation? 
    


 dialog_133
     Carlos 
                My name Carlos, I am 18 
    years old and I work as a delivery  
    man in the city.


 dialog_134
     Renne 
                Are the names Cristiano 
    Machado and Alice Zena familiar to  
    you?


 dialog_135
     Carlos 
                I don't think so, the   
    only Cristiano I know is Tulio..  
    


 dialog_136
     Renne 
                I don't know if we're  
    talking about the same person. 
    


 dialog_137
     Carlos 
                He's a dentist, he has 
    a clinic at the entrance to the  
    city.


 dialog_138
     Renne 
                Unfortunately it's not 
    the man I'm looking for. 
    


 dialog_139
     Carlos 
                Sorry.
     
    


 dialog_140
     Renne 
                There is something else
    that you can help. 
    


 dialog_141
     Renne 
                In this square, about 
    ten days ago a car sale took place. 
    


 dialog_142
     Carlos 
                Yes, the monthly car 
    sale. 
    


 dialog_143
     Renne 
                Monthly!? 
     
    


 dialog_144
     Carlos 
                Yes, every 15th day people 
    with businesses around this square  
    organize it.


 dialog_145
     Renne 
                Good... good...
     
    


 dialog_146
     Renne 
                At the last car sale a  
    man named Cristiano bought a green  
    Golf.


 dialog_147
     Renne 
                I would like more   
    information about. 
    


 dialog_148
     Carlos 
                I remember that.
     
    


 dialog_149
     Renne 
                Tell me more about it.
     
    


 dialog_150
     Carlos 
                It was a disputed sale, 
    the man who won... what was his  
    name...


 dialog_151
     Renne 
                Cristiano.
     
    


 dialog_152
     Carlos 
                Yes. He was very 
    interested in the vehicle. 
    


 dialog_153
     Renne 
                Do you remember if he  
    was with someone? 
    


 dialog_154
     Carlos 
                Hmm.
     
    


 dialog_155
     Carlos 
                He was, there was a  
    young man wearing a scarf with him. 
    


 dialog_156
     Renne 
                Wasn't there a woman with 
    him? 
    


 dialog_157
     Carlos 
                No, it was just him and 
    that man.  
    


 dialog_158
     Renne 
                Do you think there was 
    any bond between the two? Friends,  
    co-workers, family ...


 dialog_159
     Carlos 
                I don't think so, they 
    seemed distant.  
    


 dialog_160
     Renne 
                I get it.
     
    


 dialog_161
     Carlos 
                Do you excuse me, I've 
    a medical exam scheduled at the  
    club today. I don't want to miss.


 dialog_162
     Renne 
                Okay, you have been of 
    great help. 
    


 dialog_163
     Carlos 
                You're welcome.
     
    





 dialog_165
  Thirty minutes later. 
      
      


 dialog_166
  You approached a girl who was  
    in the square.  
      



 dialog_168
     Renne 
                My name is Renne, I am
    running an investigation on the 
    disappearance in this city.


 dialog_169
     Renne 
                Can I ask you a few 
    questions? It will take a few  
    minutes.


 dialog_170
     Maria 
                Of course, take your time.
     
    


 dialog_171
     Renne 
                Perfect, first I would 
    like to know your name, your age and  
    your occupation.


 dialog_172
     Maria 
                My name is Maria Vieira, 
    I'm 18 years old and I'm a student. I  
    don't have a job.


 dialog_173
     Renne 
                Right... right...
     
    


 dialog_174
     Renne 
                Here in this square 
    there is a car sale. 
    


 dialog_175
     Maria 
                The monthly car sale.
      
    


 dialog_176
     Renne 
                Precisely.
      
    


 dialog_177
     Renne 
                Were you at the last? I 
    have some questions about her.  
    


 dialog_178
     Maria 
    
                I didn't go to them, I
    don't have the money to buy a car.  
    


 dialog_179
     Renne 
                It makes sense, okay, I 
    have another question. 
    


 dialog_180
     Renne 
                Are the names Cristiano 
    Machado and Alice Zena familiar to  
    you?


 dialog_181
     Maria 
                I know these two, they 
    are famous in the city, Cristiano is  
    the most famous lawyer in the city.


 dialog_182
     Maria 
                And Alice is a teacher, 
    so all students know her, I think  
    everyone knows these two.


 dialog_183
     Renne 
                I see. These two  
    disappeared a week ago in the city, I 
    am investigating their disappearance.


 dialog_184
     Maria 
                Oh my god... I didn't 
    know that... I want to help you  
    with whatever you needg.


 dialog_185
     Renne 
                Thanks, about that do  
    you remember any of the two doing  
    something in the city? 


 dialog_186
     Maria 
                Let me see... I remember 
    Alice going to work normally, the   
    last time I saw her.


 dialog_187
     Maria 
                About Cristiano.. I 
    don't remember seeing him in  
    the last few days.. 


 dialog_188
     Renne 
                About that... 
     
    


 dialog_189
     Maria 
                But just to make it 
    clear, this is normal, he did  
    not walk around the city much.


 dialog_190  
     Maria 
                Anything else? 
      
    


 dialog_191
  Choose your next question 
      Press B to ask about Sabrina 
      Press C to ask about Carlos 






 dialog_191_1_01
     Renne 
                Minutes ago I was
    investigating with a teacher from  
    the city, Sabrina Freire.


 dialog_191_1_02
     Maria 
                I know her.
      
    


 dialog_191_1_03
     Renne 
                Do you have information 
    about her? So I can confirm her   
    testimony and build up a case.


 dialog_191_1_04
     Maria 
                Let me see, Sabrina is a
    little stubborn, she is open-minded  
    and understands everyone's problem. 


 dialog_191_1_05
     Maria 
                But once she puts something
    in mind she doesn't give up. 
     


 dialog_191_1_06
     Renne 
                This is interesting.
     
    


 dialog_191_1_07
     Renne 
                Do you believe that 
    Sabrina would have hidden anything  
    from my investigation?


 dialog_191_1_08
     Maria 
                Absolutely not, she cares 
    about Alice more than anyone. 
    


 dialog_191_1_09
     Renne 
                Why do you say that?
     
    


 dialog_191_1_10
     Maria 
                These two have been 
    friends since childhood. The two  
    grew up in this city.


 dialog_191_1_11
     Renne 
                I didn't know that, so it
    really was the break of their 
    friendship.


 dialog_191_1_12
     Maria 
                It was something that
    Sabrina told me.  
    


 dialog_191_1_13
     Renne 
                About her not hiding, do 
    you really think she wouldn't lie? 
    


 dialog_191_1_14
     Maria 
                Yes I think, she's  like  
    an open book. She always spoke during   
    classes about her life.


 dialog_191_1_15
     Renne 
                I see. 
      
    






 dialog_191_2_01
     Renne 
                Minutes ago, here in the
    square I interrogated a boy named  
    Carlos...


 dialog_191_2_02  
     Maria 
                What about him?
      
    


 dialog_191_2_03
     Renne 
                Do you have information 
    about him? So I can confirm his   
    testimony and build up a case.


 dialog_191_2_04  
     Maria 
                Unfortunately I don't
    know this Carlos you mentioned, when  
    I arrived you were writing alone.


 dialog_191_2_05
     Renne 
                It's all right... 
     
    


 dialog_191_2_06
     Renne 
                And what about you? In 
    the past ten days have you seen  
    anything strange?


 dialog_191_2_07  
     Maria 
                Let me see...
      
    


 dialog_191_2_08  
     Maria 
                I remembered something... 
    a week ago I saw two men fighting on  
    the street.


 dialog_191_2_09  
     Maria 
                They were shouting at 
    each other in the middle of the   
    night.


 dialog_191_2_10
     Renne 
                This is probably a dead 
    end...   
    


 dialog_191_2_11
     Renne 
                Do you remember 
    something that was shouted?  
    


 dialog_191_2_12  
     Maria 
                I remember them saying 
    something about dealing with loose 
    ends.


 dialog_191_2_13
     Renne 
                Interesting. 
      
    






 dialog_192
     Renne 
                Maria if you're not busy 
    I have a few more questions for you.  
    


 dialog_193  
     Maria 
                Don't worry. I am not.
     
    


 dialog_194
     Renne 
                About Cristiano, you said 
    he was popular in the city, why do   
    you say that?


 dialog_195  
     Maria 
                He being a famous lawyer
    in town, he had a lot of clients, so  
    there was always someone who know him.


 dialog_196
     Renne 
                So he was good at what he did.
       
    


 dialog_197  
     Maria 
                Yes, according to his
    customers... 
    


 dialog_198
     Renne 
                Do you know anything 
    about his work in the past ten days? 
    


 dialog_199  
     Maria 
                No I'm sorry.
     
    


 dialog_200
     Renne 
                It's all right.
     
    


 dialog_201  
     Renne 
                I had other questions 
    about him but I think that as you  
    don't know, I don't add much.


 dialog_202  
     Maria 
                ...
     
    


 dialog_203  
     Renne 
                Before I forget, I wanted
     to go to the city lighthouse, which 
     way is it?


 dialog_204  
     Maria 
                Keeps going towards the 
    border of São Paulo, and them turn  
    left. It is impossible to get lost.


 dialog_205
     Renne 
                Got it. Thanks for 
    everything Maria. 
    


 dialog_206  
     Maria 
                It was nothing.
     
    


 dialog_207
     Renne 
                Is there anything I can 
    do to make up for your lost time? 
    


 dialog_208  
     Maria 
                Don't worry, I didn't 
    have anything important to do. If  
    only the club was open...


 dialog_209
     Maria 
                Anyway, have a nice day.
     
    


 dialog_210
     Renne 
                You too.
     
    




 dialog_212
  Sao Bento do Oeste 
    City Lighthouse 
    Minutes later 



 dialog_214
     Lucas 
                Finally.
     
    


 dialog_215
     Lucas 
                The city lighthouse.
     
    


 dialog_216
     Renne 
                Hey! You.
     
    




 dialog_218
     Renne 
                Stop right there.
     
    


 dialog_219
     Lucas 
                Okay..
     
    


 dialog_220
     Renne 
                Wait a second.
     
    


 dialog_221
     Lucas 
                It's all right.
     
    


 dialog_222
     Renne 
                You are a suspect in the 
    disappearance of Cristiano Machado  
    and Alice Zena.


 dialog_223
     Lucas 
                Me?!
     
    


 dialog_224
     Renne 
                Yes, I need your name, 
    age and occupation.  
    


 dialog_225
     Lucas 
                My name is Lucas Matos, I 
    am 19 years old and I help out in the  
    city hospital.


 dialog_226
     Renne 
                Where were you ten days 
    ago?  
    


 dialog_227
     Lucas 
                Ten days ago... it was a 
    Saturday, so I was working at the  
    hospital.


 dialog_228
     Renne 
                What can you tell me 
    about the city's monthly car sale? 
    


 dialog_229
     Lucas 
                I don't know what you 
    want me to answer, I don't know  
    much about.


 dialog_230
     Lucas 
                I don't have the money to 
    buy a car so I'm not going. 
    


 dialog_231
     Renne 
                Is the name Cristiano 
    Machado similar to you? 
    


 dialog_232
     Lucas 
                Yes, he is the most 
    famous lawyer in town everyone  
    knows him.


 dialog_233
     Renne 
                I have information that a 
    young man of your age, wearing a scarf,  
    was with Cristiano at this car sale.


 dialog_234
     Lucas 
                It wasn't me, I was not
    close to Cristiano. 
    


 dialog_235
     Lucas 
                A young man close to 
    Cristiano... it's probably his  
    brother.


 dialog_236
     Renne 
                Does Cristiano have a
    brother??? 
    


 dialog_237
     Lucas 
                Yes, he has my age. 
     
    


 dialog_238
     Renne 
                Why Julia hide this 
    information from me. 
    


 dialog_239
     Lucas 
                Few people know about his 
    brother.  
    


 dialog_240
     Lucas 
                It would be dangerous for 
    a famous criminal lawyer to have a  
    known relative in the city.


 dialog_241
     Renne 
                Uhm.
     
    


 dialog_242
     Renne 
                Makes sense.
     
    


 dialog_243
     Renne 
                Answer me some more 
    questions... 
    


 dialog_244
     Lucas 
                Sure.
     
    


 dialog_245
     Renne 
                Here, the Lightouse, is 
    the last place that Cristiano and  
    Alice were seen, why you came here?


 dialog_246
     Lucas 
                I often come here to rest.
     
    


 dialog_247
     Renne 
                Got it.
     
    


 dialog_248
  Choose your next question 
      Press B to ask about Maria 
      Press C to ask about Cris's brother 



 dialog_248_1_01
     Renne 
                Minutes ago, at the
    square I interrogated a girl named  
    Maria...


 dialog_248_1_02
     Lucas 
                Maria? Why did you bring 
    that name? 
    


 dialog_248_1_03
     Renne 
                I just said... I 
    interrogated her in the square  
    minutes ago.


 dialog_248_1_04
     Lucas 
                Tss. 
     
    


 dialog_248_1_05
     Renne 
                Why are you so defensive?
     
    


 dialog_248_1_06
     Lucas 
                I know Maria Vieira, she  
    is my ex-girlfriend. 
    


 dialog_248_1_07
     Renne 
                I see, you are 
    uncomfortable, you two must have had  
    a bad break-up.


 dialog_248_1_08
     Lucas 
                It is not about that.
     
    


 dialog_248_1_09
     Lucas 
                I made a lot of mistakes 
    in this life, especially in the way I  
    treated Maria.


 dialog_248_1_10
     Renne 
                It is okay, I made 
    mistakes in past relationships too.

                It is by recognizing our 
    mistakes and learning from them that  
    we can become better persons.

     Lucas 
                Make sense, sorry about 
    that, about before, what you asked 
    about  Maria?


 dialog_248_1_13
     Renne 
                Do you believe that 
    Maria would have hidden anything  
    from my investigation?


 dialog_248_1_14
     Lucas 
                Maria? Impossible, she 
    always wants to help others, no  
    matter the cost.


 dialog_248_1_15
     Lucas 
                This is good to know.

                Tell me more about this 
    brother of Cristiano, I want to know  
    everything you know about him.


 dialog_248_2_02
     Lucas 
                I don't remember his 
    first name, as far as I remember he  
    was called Silva Macahado.


 dialog_248_2_03
     Renne 
                How was his relationship 
    with his brother? 
    


 dialog_248_2_04
     Lucas 
                It was very complicated, 
    they were always fighting, but not in  
    public.


 dialog_248_2_05
     Renne 
                I see. What about his  
    body... was he strong... tall... ? 
    


 dialog_248_2_06
     Lucas 
                He was normal like me. I 
    remember that he had black hair and a  
    scar on his neck.


 dialog_248_2_07
     Renne 
                Copy. Do you have any 
    other information about him that  
    you want to tell me about?


 dialog_248_2_08
     Lucas 
                I believe that even if he
    is not involved, Silva Macahdo will   
    know everything about what happened.


 dialog_248_2_09
     Renne 
                Why you say that?
     
    


 dialog_248_2_10
     Lucas 
                He was well informed, I
    remember seeing Cristiano asking him 
    information about the city many times
